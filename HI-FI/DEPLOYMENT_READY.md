## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Site shows 404:**

**Styles not loading:**
- All styles are inline in index.html - should work fine
- Check browser console for errors

**Images not loading:**
- Images use Unsplash CDN - should work automatically
- Check internet connection

**Deployment fails:**
- Check netlify.toml syntax
- Ensure all files are committed
- Check Netlify build logs
