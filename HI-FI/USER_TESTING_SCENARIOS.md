## Notes for User Testing

1. **Test Environment**: Use modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. **Test Data**: Demo restaurants and items pre-populated
3. **State Persistence**: Clear localStorage to start fresh if needed: `localStorage.clear()`
4. **Screen Sizes**: Test on mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1920px)
5. **Accessibility**: Test with keyboard only, screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)

## Known Limitations

1. **Demo Data**: Uses simulated restaurants and items
2. **Payment**: Simulated processing (no real transactions)
3. **Delivery**: No actual delivery integration
4. **Food Type Filter**: Placeholder (shows toast message)
5. **Some Profile Sections**: Placeholders (Addresses, Payment Methods, Settings)

All three core tasks are **fully functional** and ready for user testing!
