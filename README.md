## üéì Design Decisions

### Why Budget-First?
Students have limited budgets and need to see options within their means immediately, not after browsing.

### Why Dual Slider?
Provides flexibility - students can set both minimum (avoid too cheap) and maximum (stay within budget).

### Why Bottom Navigation?
Mobile-first design with thumb-friendly access to key functions (Home, Cart, Profile).

### Why Cost Preview?
Transparency - students see total cost including fees before committing to a restaurant.

### Why Two Browse Modes?
Different use cases:
- **Restaurant Mode**: Brand loyalty, browsing menus
- **Food Items Mode**: Quick search for specific cravings

### Why Order History?
Students often reorder favorites and need to track spending over time.
